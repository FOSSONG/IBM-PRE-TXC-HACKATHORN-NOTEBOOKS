It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: <a href=\"/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-prompt-save.html?context=wx\" target=\"_blank\">Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook.</a>\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.10.\n\n## Notebook goals\nThe learning goals of this notebook are:\n\n* Defining a Python function for obtaining credentials from the IBM Cloud personal API key\n* Defining parameters of the Model object\n* Using the Model object to generate response using the defined model id, parameters and the prompt input\n\n# Setup"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## watsonx API connection\nThis cell defines the credentials required to work with watsonx API for Foundation\nModel inferencing.\n\n**Action:** Provide the IBM Cloud personal API key.
